  # No te asocies con cínicos y pesimistas. Sus creencias son autocumplidas.

  # Aprende a vender. Aprende a construir. Si puedes hacer ambas cosas, serás imparable.

  # Ármate con conocimiento específico, responsabilidad y apalancamiento.

  # El conocimiento específico es el conocimiento para el que no puedes ser entrenado. Si la sociedad puede entrenarlo, puede entrenar a otra persona y reemplazarlo.
